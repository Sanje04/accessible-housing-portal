## Roles

| Role      | Current capabilities                                                                                        |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `admin`   | Manage users, manage custom listing fields, create/edit/archive listings, view all draft/archived listings. |
| `partner` | Create/edit/archive own listings, use "My Listings", view own drafts/archives.                              |
| `user`    | View signed-in listing search and published listing details. Cannot write listings or access admin areas.   |

## User Statuses

| Status        | Meaning                                                          |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `invited`     | Account exists but invite has not been accepted. Cannot sign in. |
| `active`      | Account can sign in.                                             |
| `suspended`   | Account cannot sign in.                                          |
| `deactivated` | Account cannot sign in.                                          |

`isUserAllowedToSignIn` currently allows only `active`.

## Sign-In Flow

Credentials sign-in is configured in `auth.ts`.

```text
sign-in form
  -> signInWithPassword server action
  -> NextAuth credentials provider
  -> getUserForAuth(email)
  -> optional ensureBootstrapAdmin(email, password)
  -> verifyPassword
  -> recordSuccessfulLogin
  -> JWT session with role/status
```

The session callback adds `id`, `role`, and `status` to `session.user`. Type augmentation is in `types/next-auth.d.ts`.

## Bootstrap Admin

If `ADMIN_PASSWORD` is set, the credentials provider can create or update a bootstrap admin account when signing in with:

- `ADMIN_EMAIL`, defaulting to `admin@example.com`
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD`

This works only while no admin user already has a stored password hash. It is intended for first-run setup and local/development recovery.

## Invites

Admins create invites through `createAccountService`, which delegates to `createInvite`.

Invite behavior:

- email is normalized to lowercase
- existing user records are reused by email
- new user records start with status `invited`
- invite tokens are opaque and stored only as hashes
- unaccepted active invites for the same user are expired when a new invite is created
- invite URLs are generated from `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`, then `AUTH_URL`, then `http://localhost:3000`
- when email is requested, the invite and its pg-boss job are written in the same transaction
- successful invite creation means the email is queued, not submitted
- the worker requires `EMAIL_WORKER_ENABLED=true`, `RESEND_API_KEY`, and `EMAIL_FROM`
- admin lists derive `queued`, `submitted`, `failed`, or `not_requested` from persisted queue timestamps; `submitted` means provider acceptance, not confirmed recipient-server delivery

Invite acceptance:

```text
/invite?token=...
  -> acceptInviteAction
  -> validate token and password
  -> getPendingInviteByToken
  -> hashPassword
  -> acceptInvite transaction
  -> sign in with credentials
  -> redirect("/")
```

Password rules:

- 8 to 72 characters
- at least one letter
- at least one number
- confirmation must match

## Protected Routes

`proxy.ts` exports NextAuth's `auth` as the Next.js proxy. `lib/auth/route-policy.ts` decides which requests require an auth session:

- pages under `/admin`
- pages under `/listings`
- pages under `/listing-form`
- pages under `/my-listings`
- APIs under `/api/admin`
- all APIs under `/api/listings`

This is a broad gate, not the complete authorization model. Route layouts, server actions, API handlers, and services still enforce role-specific behavior.

Route-group layouts add user-facing protection:

- `app/(admin)/admin/layout.tsx` requires an active admin.
- `app/(listing-author)/layout.tsx` requires an active admin or partner.

API/session helpers:

- `getOptionalSession` returns a valid active session/user pair when available.
- `requireSession` returns a `401` response when no active session exists.
- `requireAdminSession` returns `403` for non-admins.
- `requireListingWriteSession` returns `403` for non-admin/non-partner users.

## Account Admin

Admins manage accounts through `/admin/users` and `/api/admin/accounts`.

Current behavior:

- list accounts with role, status, and search filters
- invite an account
- inspect one account
- update name, role, status, and organization
- deactivate an account
- list recent unaccepted, unexpired invites, including queued, sent, failed, and manually shared invites

Safety rules in `account-policy.ts`:

- only admins can manage accounts
- admins cannot remove their own admin access
- users cannot deactivate their own account through the admin API

## Custom Listing Field Admin

Admins manage dynamic listing fields through `/admin/custom-listing-fields` and `/api/admin/custom-listing-fields`.

Field definition behavior:

- `key` is unique and should be treated as stable once listings use it.
- `category` is normalized to uppercase in admin services.
- `publicOnly` maps to `is_public`.
- `filterableOnly` maps to `is_filterable`.
- `required` maps to `is_required`.
- `options` stores select/multi-select choices.
- reorder requires every field in a category exactly once with contiguous sort order.

Listing filters currently use public, filterable, boolean field definitions.

## Email

Email is intentionally isolated and asynchronous:

- `createInvite` writes the invite and enqueues an `email_send` pg-boss job in one transaction.
- `instrumentation.ts` starts the worker only in the Node.js runtime when `EMAIL_WORKER_ENABLED=true`.
- `lib/email-queue/worker.ts` is the only delivery path and calls the shared service in `lib/email.ts`.
- transient provider failures retry with bounded exponential backoff; rate limits and daily quota exhaustion can defer delivery.
- permanently failing jobs move to `email_send_dead_letter`, and the worker records `email_failed_at` for the invite.
- successful delivery records `sent_at`; no requested email leaves `email_queued_at` unset and produces `not_requested`.

Job payloads identify the invite without storing recipient details in the queue. The one-time invite URL is sealed with AES-256-GCM under a key derived from `AUTH_SECRET` and redacted after a terminal outcome. Rotating `AUTH_SECRET` while jobs are queued makes their sealed URLs unreadable and causes those jobs to fail.

Do not create Resend clients in UI or route handlers or add another delivery path around the queue. New email types must extend the job contract and both the send and dead-letter handlers.

## Adding Protected Behavior

When adding a protected feature:

1. Decide which roles can access it.
2. Add or reuse a policy function in `lib/policies`.
3. Gate route UI with a layout or page-level server check when needed.
4. Gate API/services with session helpers and policy checks.
5. Return `401` for no session, `403` for wrong role, and `404` when hiding private resource existence is intentional.
6. Add tests for the policy or route-policy behavior when the rule is non-trivial.
