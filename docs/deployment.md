# Deployment And Operations

This project currently has CI, a production-oriented Dockerfile, a local development Docker Compose stack, a development Dockerfile, and Infisical-backed secret commands. There is no documented one-command production deployment in the repository, so treat this file as the operational reference for what the repo itself defines.

## CI

GitHub Actions workflow: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

Triggers:

- pull requests targeting `main`
- pushes to `main`
- pushes to `rewrite`
- manual workflow dispatch

Jobs:

CI uses Node 22 with npm cache enabled.

## Dockerfile

`Dockerfile` is production-oriented:

1. Starts from `node:22.14.0-slim`.
2. Installs `openssl`, `curl`, `bash`, `ca-certificates`, and Infisical CLI.
3. Runs `npm ci`.
4. Copies the repository.
5. Runs `npm run build`.
6. Sets `NODE_ENV=production` and `PORT=3100`.
7. Starts through `infisical run --env=prod --projectId=2980a086-4367-4a1a-aafd-d1f5d4879253`.

The container command runs:

```bash
npm run start -- --hostname 0.0.0.0 --port ${PORT}
```

## Docker Compose

`docker-compose.yml` is a local development stack. It currently defines:

- `db`, a `postgres:16-alpine` container named `ahp-db`
- `app`, a Next.js development container named `ahp-app`

The database service:

- creates the `affordable_housing_portal` database
- uses `postgres` / `postgres` local credentials
- exposes `${POSTGRES_PORT:-5433}:5432`
- stores data in the `ahp-postgres-data` volume
- includes a `pg_isready` healthcheck

The app service:

- builds from `Dockerfile.dev`
- waits for the database healthcheck
- mounts the repository into `/app`
- exposes `3000:3000`
- sets development defaults for auth, app URL, bootstrap admin, and email variables
- sets `EMAIL_WORKER_ENABLED=true` so the development server processes queued email
- runs `npm run db:migrate && npm run db:seed && npm run dev -- --hostname 0.0.0.0 --port 3000`

Commands:

```bash
npm run docker:up
npm run docker:logs
npm run docker:down
npm run docker:down:volumes
```

## Development Dockerfile

`Dockerfile.dev` is a development image:

- starts from `node:22.14.0-slim`
- runs `npm ci`
- copies the repo
- exposes port 3000
- runs `npm run dev -- --hostname 0.0.0.0 --port 3000`

The Docker Compose `app` service builds from `Dockerfile.dev` and overrides its default command to run migrations and seeds before `next dev`.

## Runtime Environment

Production runtime needs the same app-level variables described in [Getting Started](getting-started.md), usually supplied by Infisical:

- `DATABASE_URL`
- `AUTH_SECRET`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` and/or `AUTH_URL`
- `RESEND_API_KEY` and `EMAIL_FROM` if invite emails are sent
- `EMAIL_WORKER_ENABLED=true` on the long-lived server that should process queued email
- `AUTH_TRUST_HOST=true` when running behind a trusted proxy/container host
- optional `ADMIN_EMAIL` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` only for bootstrap/recovery workflows

The local Docker Compose stack does not require `INFISICAL_TOKEN`; it uses development defaults and the Compose database URL. The production Dockerfile command still requires Infisical access.

## Migrations

The production Docker image does not automatically run migrations. Apply migrations explicitly before or during release with the environment pointed at the target database.

The local Docker Compose app service does run migrations and seeds on startup against the Compose Postgres service.

Available commands:

```bash
npm run db:migrate
npm run db:migrate:secrets
```

Use `db:migrate:secrets` when Infisical `dev` secrets are the intended target. For production, verify the Infisical environment and database target before running migrations.

The `user_invites.email_queued_at` and `email_failed_at` columns are managed through the committed Drizzle migration. pg-boss separately creates and migrates its own `pgboss` schema when the queue starts; do not generate a Drizzle migration for that schema.

## Transactional Email Worker

`instrumentation.ts` starts the in-process pg-boss worker only in the Node.js runtime and only when `EMAIL_WORKER_ENABLED=true`. Enable it on the long-lived application server. If every process leaves the variable unset, requests can still enqueue jobs but no process will deliver them.

The worker retries transient provider failures with bounded exponential backoff, honors `Retry-After`, and defers daily quota failures without consuming retries. Permanent failures and exhausted retry/deferral chains enter `email_send_dead_letter`; the dead-letter worker records the failure on the source invite so the admin UI can surface it.

Monitor server logs for `[email-queue]` errors and inspect the pg-boss queues when invites remain queued. Treat `AUTH_SECRET` rotation as an operational migration: queued invite URLs are encrypted with a derived key, so drain or replace outstanding jobs before rotating it.

## Build-Safe Server Code

`next build` evaluates modules. Server clients that require runtime secrets should be lazily initialized. The database client already follows this pattern in `db/client.ts`.

When adding new server integrations:

- do not create SDK clients at module scope if they require environment variables
- expose a getter or lazy proxy
- fail with a clear error only when the integration is actually used
- keep integration code in server-only modules

## Release Checklist

1. CI is green.
2. Database migrations are reviewed and applied to the target database.
3. Required secrets, including `EMAIL_WORKER_ENABLED=true` on the worker process, exist in the target Infisical environment.
4. `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`/`AUTH_URL` match the public deployment URL.
5. Invite email settings are valid and the worker starts successfully if account invites will send email.
6. The container is started with the intended `PORT`.
7. Smoke test sign-in, listing search, listing detail, admin access, image retrieval, and invite submission status from queued to submitted or failed.
