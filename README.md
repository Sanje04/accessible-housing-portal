# Affordable Housing Portal

Affordable Housing Portal is [Civic Tech Waterloo Region](https://github.com/CivicTechWR)'s affordable housing platform. It helps housing seekers find affordable housing listings and gives housing providers a place to publish richer, more accessible listing information.

The app is a Next.js 16 App Router application using React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4, shadcn/ui primitives, NextAuth credentials auth, Drizzle ORM, Postgres, and Zod-based API contracts.

Current product areas include:

- signed-in listing search, map/list views, and listing detail pages
- partner/admin listing authoring with draft autosave and image uploads
- partner/admin "My Listings" management
- admin account invites, account management, and custom listing fields
- listing filters powered by admin-configured listing field definitions

## Documentation

Start with [docs/README.md](docs/README.md). The developer reference is split by topic so new contributors can find the right level of detail quickly:

- [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md) for local setup, environment variables, database setup, and scripts
- [Architecture](docs/architecture.md) for the App Router structure, service/repository boundaries, and feature workflow
- [Domain Model](docs/domain-model.md) for database tables, enums, relationships, and migration rules
- [Listings](docs/listings.md) for listing search, listing details, authoring, draft autosave, image uploads, and custom fields
- [Auth and Admin](docs/auth-and-admin.md) for NextAuth credentials auth, invites, roles, access checks, and admin tools
- [API Reference](docs/api-reference.md) for route handlers, schemas, endpoint behavior, and error responses
- [Deployment and Operations](docs/deployment.md) for CI, Docker, Infisical, runtime settings, and migration expectations
- [Testing and Quality](docs/testing-and-quality.md) for Jest, linting, formatting, hooks, and review expectations
- [ADR 0001](docs/adr/0001-server-first-listings-data-fetching.md) for the server-first listings data decision

## Quick Start

Prerequisites:

- Node.js 22.12 or newer
- npm with the committed `package-lock.json`
- a reachable Postgres database

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm ci
```

Create a local environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Set `DATABASE_URL` to your local database. The committed example uses:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:5432/affordable_housing_portal
```

If you use the Docker Compose database from this repo, set the host port to `5433`:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:5433/affordable_housing_portal
```

Apply migrations and seed local development data:

```bash
npm run db:migrate
npm run db:seed
```

Start the app:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

The Docker Compose workflow starts Postgres and the development app together, then runs migrations and seed data before `next dev`:

```bash
npm run docker:up
```

## Transactional Email Queue

Transactional emails, currently admin invites, are queued durably in Postgres with pg-boss instead of being sent inline. Invite creation and job enqueueing happen in the same transaction, and the worker started from `instrumentation.ts` records whether the provider accepted the request or the job permanently failed. Provider acceptance does not confirm delivery to the recipient's mail server; delivered, bounced, failed, and suppressed webhook outcomes are not currently reconciled.

Set `EMAIL_WORKER_ENABLED=true` on the long-lived app server that should process jobs. Docker Compose enables it by default. See [Auth and Admin](docs/auth-and-admin.md) for submission behavior and [Deployment and Operations](docs/deployment.md) for worker, retry, dead-letter, and secret-rotation guidance.

## Common Commands

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm run format:check
npm test
npm run test:unit
npm run build
```

Use `npm run format` and `npm run lint:fix` for mechanical fixes.

## Contributing

Development tasks are managed through [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/CivicTechWR/affordable-housing-portal/issues).

Before opening a PR, run the relevant checks and include testing notes. The pre-commit hook runs secret scanning, `lint-staged`, and `npm run typecheck`; the pre-push hook runs `npm run build`.
